<p>  According to data collected by the 2020 census, Black Americans are reversing the Great Migration and adding back down South. The Great Migration took place between 1916 and 1970. During, this time six million Black Americans moved from the South to the North to escape racial segregation, and meager economic conditions. </p>

<p> Many young Black Americans are seeking to leave the places in which their grandparents went to seek refuge to return to the south. William H. Frey, PhD who is a demographer, sociologist, and author of Diversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics are Remaking America argues that the slowdown of employment and the progressively worse race relations in the North have caused Black people to move down South. States like Losuiana, Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi have seen a ninety percent  increase of its Black population.

According to research done by Frey, Black people are more likely to choose the South as a destination  to live than their white counterparts. Frey found that college-educated Black people are leading the migration to the South. States that once attracted Black Americans like Califionia are losing more black migrants then it gained during the 1990s, and Georgia has the largest gain of Black migrants.

The effects of this New Great Migration have yet to be discovered, but with the historic ties that Black Americans have the South like slavery and raical segraition, it is importnat to exmaine and further think about the effects that the New Great Migraition can have.
